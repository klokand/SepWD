<h3>What is acupuncture?</h3>
<p>Acupuncture is a natural, safe and effective treatment which works by inserting sterilized fine needles into specific sites-- acupoints on the human body. It has been used as part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for more than 3000 years, making it one of the oldest and most long-standing healing practices in the world. TCM views the body as a 
whole and treats conditions holistically, alleviating not only the symptoms but the root problem as well. All over the world, Acupuncture is widely accepted to treat various kinds of disorders.</p>
<h3>How does acupuncture work?</h3>
<p>Acupoints are the specific points located along the meridians (a network of invisible channels) through the body where the Qi (pronounced “Chi”, means vital energy) is both concentrated and accessible. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles, if there is an internal imbalance or blockage in Qi, disorders will occur.  
Acupuncture engages the Qi by inserting the sterilized needles into these specific points, the goal being to restore the proper flow of Qi. Each acupoint has a predictable effect upon the vital energy passing through it and as the body regains its natural balance, well-being returns.</p>
<p>Billions of people have testified that acupuncture is effective and lots of controlled studies both in China and West shown that acupuncture works for a variety of diseases.</p>
<h3>How many treatments do I need?</h3>
<p>We’ll do a consultation for you at your first visit, and discuss the treatment plan with you before the acupuncture. Our consultation contains the four diagnostic methods of TCM: inspection, auscultation&olfaction, inquiring and pulse-taking, which are used to diagnose your disorder and know your physical condition. Additionally, there are several factors taken into account such as the duration and intensity of your disorder, your age, constitution and individual circumstances, your desired health goal, and etc.</p>
<p>For most common ailment it takes about 3-5 treatments. More severe and chronic cases may take up to 8-12 treatment sessions. For fertility and period issues, it usually takes 3-5 cycles.

<h3>Does acupuncture hurt?</h3>
<p>Not really.</p><p>Many people shy away from acupuncture just due to “the fear of needles”. However, unlike the injection needles everybody knows, acupuncture needles are very fine and smooth. The gauge of some needles we used in our clinic can be as little as 0.12 mm. Most clients feel no pain when we insert the needles into the body.</p>
<p>When the needles are in the Acupoints, you may feel slightly sensation as either pressure, tightness, numbness or a sensation of heat. These sensation are called “De Qi” (“Feeling the Energy”). With the “De Qi” sensation, we can help adjust and re-balance the energy in your body.</p><p>Actually, most of our clients feel calming and relaxing during and after the treatment.</p>
<h3>Do you re-use the needles?</h3>
<p>Never.</p><p>Our acupuncturists are fully qualified conscientious practitioners. We follow strictly infectious control procedure in the clinic.</p><p><strong>For your safety only sterile, single-use disposable needles are used in our clinic.</strong></p>
