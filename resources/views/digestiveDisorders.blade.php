<p>Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been helping digestive function for

thousands of years. As TCM addresses healing from a holistic perspective, we see 

that a healthy digestive system is the root of all wellness. Our digestive systems is 

connected to our immune system, and being able to absorb all vital nutrients and 

eliminate all excess products efficiently is necessary for the health of all the bodies 

tissues: muscles, nerves, organs, blood and vessels.</p>
