<h1>Mental Disorders</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/mental-illness.jpg">
<p>Emotional Disorders can be triggered by a personâ€™s general health and constitution, 

challenging life situations, trauma, drug and alcohol abuse, chronic pain, hormonal 

fluctuations and sometimes there may be no obvious cause! In traditional Chinese 

medicine, mental disorders are understood to be the result of disharmony or imbalance in 

the body. By this logic, treating mental illness becomes a matter of recognizing the 

patterns of disharmony and restoring balance to the body.</p>
<p>Acupuncture can be used to affect the release of neurochemical messenger molecules,

triggering biochemical changes that cultivate physical and emotional wellbeing. By 

rectifying these imbalances through acupuncture, the body and mind are brought back 

into sync, restoring mental health and wellbeing. At Acu8 Health, We utilize natural & 

safe methods such as Acupuncture, Chinese Herbal Medicine and Massage to treat a 

wide range of mental conditions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Insomnia</li>

	<li>Depression</li>
	<li>Anxiety</li>
	<li>Panic Attack</li>
</ul>
