<h1>Womenâ€™s health</h1>
<p>Women have special health needs that change with age. At Acu8 Health, our Practitioners are experienced in helping women to improve and manage their health through every stage of the lifecycle. A woman experiences significant phases of hormonal change from adolescence, through pregnancy and motherhood and into menopause and older age. These changes influence not only her menstrual cycle, but her general health as well and may herald changes in nutritional needs, physical ability and susceptibility to illness or disease.</p>
<p>We utilize Acupuncture Chinese Herbal Medicine, Massage, Cupping as well as Moxibustion to help women with:
<ul>
	<li>Menopause</li>
	<li>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</li>
	<li>Endometriosis</li>
	<li>Irregular Periods/Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding</li>
	<li>PMS</li>
</ul>
