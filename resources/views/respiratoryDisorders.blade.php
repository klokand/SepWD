<h1>Respiratory Disorders</h1>
<p>Respiratory Disorders are most common issues everyone will suffer from. Genetics, 

environmental conditions, pollution, diet, digestive impairment, lifestyle factors, immune 

deficiencies and emotional stress can all play a part in the development of respiratory 

illness.</p>
<p>In Chinese medicine, respiratory illness represents a blockage in the flow of energy in the 

lungs. Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine promote the natural flow of energy (Qi) 

in the body, assisting in regulating lung function and reducing excessive mucus, phlegm 

and inflammation.  At the same time, immune system is strengthened to help prevent 

recurrence of symptoms.</p>
