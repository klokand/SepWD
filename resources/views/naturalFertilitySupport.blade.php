<h1>Natural Fertility Support</h1>
<p>Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine restore the natural balance body and can be effective in treating both male and female infertility.</p>
<h3>Female Infertility</h3>
<p>Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine can improve a woman’s chances of 
conception by regulating the hormones, increasing the ovary’s function, thickening the lining of the uterus, and bringing on ovulation.</p>
<p>Research and clinical observation has shown that Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine are able to increase the body’s progesterone level and regulate the levels of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), Estrogen (which increases as the follicle grows), and LH (the luteinizing hormone, which, in women, heralds the imminent release of the egg).</p><p>Chinese Medicine considers that a proper balance of these hormones is woman’s ability to conceive.  Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been found to assist in establishing and maintaining a balance of both the reproductive and stress hormones, leading to a healthier menstrual cycle and a subsequent increase in the chances of falling pregnant.</p>
<h3>Male Infertility</h3>
<p>Recent research tells us that, in Australia, one in twenty men is infertile, meaning that male infertility is implicated in one in five cases where a couple is having problems conceiving. The most common cause of male infertility is problems with sperm production, with one in 25 males suffering from a low sperm count.</p><p>Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine can increase the sperm count and improve the sperm’s motility and morphology. While sperm quality issues can often improve after 3 months of Acupuncture and Chinese medicine treatment, sometimes it may take longer depending on the severity of the problem. Infertility Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine also strengthen the internal organs, such as the kidneys, liver and spleen, adding to the overall health of the male reproductive system.</p><p>Let acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine aid in your efforts to conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy to term.
