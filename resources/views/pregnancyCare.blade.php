Recent studies have also shown promising results in using acupuncture for depression during and after pregnancy.</p>
<h3>Breech babies</h3>
<p>Acupuncture can also help with more serious issues during pregnancy. Specific acupuncture points and techniques are very useful for turning “breech babies” (those positioned feet first). One study concluded that foetal mal-presentation is a relatively simple, efficacious and inexpensive method for breech birth presentation. “Treatment involves applying heat from the burning of the herb mugwort to a point(moxibustion) just outside the nail of the little toe. The treatment causes no adverse side effects.</p>
