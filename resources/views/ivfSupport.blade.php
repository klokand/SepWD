<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/babyIVF1200.jpg">
<p>Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been used to treat infertility both for men and women for a few thousand years. Recently a number of clinical studies show that acupuncture and Chinese medicine treatment can increase the likelihood of conception, by improving the thickness of the uterine lining, the follicle development and the quality of the eggs.</p>
<p>Using in vitro fertilization (IVF) alone, women have a 1 in 4 chance of falling pregnant. A recent review of acupuncture’s effect on IVF treatment in the British Medical Journal stated that acupuncture could increase a woman’s chance of pregnancy by 65%. At the same time, Acupuncture IVF is safe and no adverse effects were reported.</p>
<p>In our clinic, acupuncture IVF support program is based on these evidence-based protocols. Our kind and experienced practitioners will design the treatments plan which suit you best.</p>

<h3>Prior to Starting Your IVF Cycle</h3>
<p>Acupuncture & Chinese herbs prior to starting your IVF cycle helps balance your body including regulating your cycle, assisting with ovulation and Improve semen quality and quantity. To create a flourishing garden, first we imbue the earth with nutrients & moisten   
mulch and then we till the soil. We do these things before we plant the seeds.</p>
<p>We recommend that once or twice weekly acupuncture treatments for 4-6 weeks prior to IVF medication to prepare your body. This procedure is the same prior to frozen embryo transfers. However, if you have missed this window, do not worry. Our practitioners will assess and recommend an individualized treatment plan for you. We believe your own 
reproductive and overall health are the foundations of a successful IVF program, a sustained pregnancy and a healthy baby.</p>
<h3>During the Stimulation Phase</h3>
<p>Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine can help the ovaries respond better to the stimulation drugs by producing more follicles and good quality eggs. It can also thicken the lining of the uterus to prepare for the transfer of embryos and reduce the side-effects of the drugs.</p>
<p>We recommend once or twice weekly acupuncture treatments during this phase.</p>
<h3>After egg collection</h3>
<p>After egg collection, IVF acupuncture can reduce any local tissue trauma or bleeding and help prepare a better environment for the arrival of an embryo.</p>
<p>We recommend one treatment 1~2 days after the egg collection.</p>
<h3>On the day of embryo transfer (including frozen embryo transfer)</h3>
<p>Research has shown very positive results having one session of acupuncture before embryo transfer and one after transfer. These treatments show an increase of both clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates.</p>
<p>We recommend two acupuncture treatments before and after embryo transfers within 24 hours.</p>
<h3>After embryo transfer</h3>
<p>Acupuncture during this period potentially supports the implantation process, keeps your energy up and mind calm. </p>
<p>We recommend 3-4 treatments between the time of embryo transfer and the pregnancy test.  If your pregnancy test is positive, we would strongly recommend ongoing treatments throughout your first semester.</p>

For some men whose semen have no sperm and may require testicular biopsy as part of the IVF procedures, acupuncture can help the production of their sperm.</p><p>We recommend once or twice weekly acupuncture treatments for 4-6 weeks prior to sperm donation and 1 treatment before sperm donation to reduce anxiety and increase blood flow to the genital area.</p><p>Let acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine aid in your efforts to conceive and carry a
