<h1>Miscarriage Prevention</h1>
<p>Miscarriages are a problem that many women experience whilst trying to conceive. It is suggested that 10-25% of all women will have one miscarriage. Of these women 1-3 % will suffer from repeated spontaneous miscarriages which mean 3 consecutive miscarriages. Some figures suggest that IVF clients who are over 40 have a 50% chance of miscarriage. And most of miscarriages occur during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>
Although not uncommon, miscarriages can be incredibly distressing and disheartening. Many women have numerous tests only to find out that their miscarriages are due to unknown factors. And they get little help from Western Medicine. It is then that many women turn to traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) which can not only aid in conception, but also help to maintain a healthy pregnancy for 9 months.</p><p>First of all, Chinese herbal medicine and Acupuncture can improve the ovarian function
to help produce high-quality eggs. Secondly, these two natural therapies can increase blood flow to the uterus and thicken uterine lining in order to support healthy embryo/fetus growth. Acupuncture is also a recognized method for managing stress and reducing anxiety, making pregnancy a healthier and happier time for both mother and baby.</p><p>Typically we recommend weekly sessions for 3 months before conception and weekly session through the first trimester. If you are currently pregnant we can also treat you weekly until first trimester finishes.</p><p>Other advice</p>

	<li>Take adequate rest and avoid carrying or lifting heavy things.</li>
	<li>Eat a healthy antioxidant rich diet.</li>
